# Portfolio_Java
Welcome to my **Java Fundamentals Portfolio**, a curated collection of beginner-to-intermediate level Java programs developed as part of my learning journey. This repository demonstrates core programming concepts using Java — including data types, control structures, user input, and array handling through simple, well-structured examples and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## 📁 Repository Overview

This repository is organized into folders and standalone `.java` files representing distinct learning topics:

### 🔹 Folder Structure

| Folder / File               | Description                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Basics_Java/`             | Covers basic syntax, variables, data types, and typecasting   |
| `conditionals and loop/`   | Programs using `if`, `switch`, and looping constructs         |
| `Arrays_Java/`             | Programs related to array creation, iteration, and operations |
| `First.java`               | Classic “Hello World” program                                 |
| `Inputs.java`              | User input with `Scanner`                                     |
| `Calculation.java`         | Basic arithmetic and expressions                              |
| `Mydatatype.java`          | Practical use of data types                                   |
| `Typecasting.java`         | Type conversion (widening and narrowing)                      |
| `Temperature.java`         | Conversion logic (e.g., Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)                 |

## 💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### ✅ Java Basics
- Program structure and syntax
- Printing to the console
- Writing your first Java class and `main()` method

### 🔢 Variables & Data Types
- Primitive types: `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`
- Non-primitive type: `String`
- Typecasting and constants

### 📥 Input & Output
- Using the `Scanner` class for user input
- Handling different input types (string, integer, float, etc.)

### ➗ Operators & Expressions
- Arithmetic and relational operators
- Logical and assignment operations

### 🔀 Conditional Statements
- `if`, `else if`, and `else` conditions
- `switch-case` branching for multiple choice logic

### 🔁 Looping Constructs
- `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops
- Loop control using `break` and `continue`

### 🧮 Arrays (1D)
- Declaring and initializing arrays
- Iterating with loops
- Basic operations: searching, summing, and printing
