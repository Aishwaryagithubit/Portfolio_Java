# Portfolio_Java
Welcome to my **Java Fundamentals Portfolio**, a collection of beginner to intermediate level Java programs developed as part of my learning journey. This repository demonstrates core programming concepts using Java — including data types, control structures, user input, and array handling through simple, well-structured examples and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## 💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### ✅ Java Basics
- Program structure and syntax
- Printing to the console
- Writing your first Java class and `main()` method

### 🔢 Variables & Data Types
- Primitive types: `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`
- Non-primitive type: `String`
- Typecasting and constants

### 📥 Input & Output
- Using the `Scanner` class for user input
- Handling different input types (string, integer, float, etc.)

### ➗ Operators & Expressions
- Arithmetic and relational operators
- Logical and assignment operations

### 🔀 Conditional Statements
- if, else if, and else conditions
- `switch-case` branching for multiple choice logic

### 🔁 Functions
- return type
- no return type

  ### 🔁 Looping Constructs
- `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops
- Loop control using `break` and `continue`

### 🧮 Arrays (1D)
- Declaring and initializing arrays
- Iterating with loops
- Basic operations: searching, summing, and printing
