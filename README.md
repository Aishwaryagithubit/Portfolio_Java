# Portfolio_Java
Welcome to my **Java Fundamentals Portfolio**, a collection of beginner to intermediate level Java programs developed as part of my learning journey. This repository demonstrates core programming concepts using Java including data types, control structures, user input, and array handling through simple, well-structured examples and Object Oriented Programming concepts.


## 💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### ✅ Java Basics
- Program structure and syntax
- Printing to the console
- Writing your first Java class and main() method

### 🔢 Variables & Data Types
- Primitive types: int, double, char, boolean
- Non-primitive type: String
- Typecasting and constants

### 📥 Input & Output
- Using the Scanner class for user input
- Handling different input types (string, integer, float, etc.)

### ➗ Operators & Expressions
- Arithmetic and relational operators
- Logical and assignment operations

### 🔀 Conditional Statements
- if, else if, and else conditions
- `switch-case` branching for multiple choice logic

### 🔁 Functions
- return type
- no return type

  ### 🔁 Looping Constructs
- `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops
- Loop control using `break` and `continue`

### 🧮 Arrays (1D)
- Declaring and initializing arrays
- Iterating with loops
- Basic operations: searching, summing, and printing

### Class


###  Linear Search
